# Autonomy in Kikon-tai

Kikon-tai is designed around the principle of **functional autonomy**â€”a system capable of understanding high-level goals, planning intermediate steps, and delivering working output with minimal direction.

## Design Principles

- **Deterministic Agent Flow**: Agents are predictable, traceable, and testable.
- **Structured Interfaces**: All agents follow a standard YAML interface and `handle(task)` pattern.
- **Reversible Output**: Kikon-tai logs every operation and structures output for easy rollback or iteration.

## Future Direction

- Agent health metrics and error recovery
- Feedback loops and priority escalation
- Human-AI collaboration modes

Kikon-tai aspires to become a general-purpose AI development partner. This foundation is just the beginning.
