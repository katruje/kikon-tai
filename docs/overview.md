# Kikon-tai Overview

Kikon-tai is an autonomous development agent designed to plan, build, and maintain modular software systems through a loop-based execution model. It specializes in decomposing high-level goals into executable tasks, coordinating specialized agents, and delivering clean project scaffolding with GitHub-native workflows.

Kikon-tai is especially suited for tasks like resume generators, client deliverable platforms, and agent-driven developer tooling.

## Why Kikon-tai?

- **Agent-based design**: Modular agents with single responsibilities make the system adaptable and easy to extend.
- **Autonomous operations**: Designed to bootstrap and deliver working prototypes with minimal human input.
- **Portfolio-grade output**: Capable of submitting pull requests and building projects for public consumption.
