agent_name: roadmap_agent
description: >
  The roadmap_agent is responsible for transforming structured project requirements
  into a phased development plan. It produces a clear, actionable roadmap that
  can be used to guide agent coordination, backlog generation, and MVP tracking.

inputs:
  - requirements_yaml: >
      The structured project specification created by the interviewer_agent.
  - project_status: >
      Optional input from sync_agent indicating progress, blockers, or scope adjustments.

outputs:
  - roadmap_md: >
      A multi-phase Markdown file outlining the development strategy,
      milestones, dependencies, and expected deliverables.

behavior:
  - Interpret requirements to define development phases.
  - Prioritize tasks that enable quick feedback and iterative refinement.
  - Flag missing or ambiguous requirements for client follow-up.
  - Keep roadmap concise and portfolio-presentable.

triggers:
  - On update to requirements.yaml
  - On command by the project_manager or genki_engine

dependencies:
  - requirements.yaml
  - role_configs.yaml

  expected_behavior_on_run:
    - Load the client brief from `client_portal/client_brief.md`
    - Extract project name, objective, scope, and status
    - Generate a phased roadmap with 3â€“5 stages based on MVP features
    - Output `data/roadmap.md` using standard formatting
    - Print console status for each phase defined

  next_steps:
    - Define the roadmap phases in YAML or Markdown
    - Create roadmap_agent.py to hold logic
    - Add roadmap_agent to genki_engine dispatch if not already present
